Source and Sink :

A source and a sink are, as their names imply,
 places data comes from and goes to. Sources
 and sinks are built on data sets. ADF is
 mostly concerned with moving data from one 
place to another, often with some kind of 
transformation along the way, so it needs to
 know where to move the data.

It is important to understand that there is
 mushy distinction between data sets and 
sources/sinks. A data set defines a particular
 collection of data, but a source or sink can
 redefine the collection. For example, suppose 
DataSet1 is defined as the folder /Vehicles/GM/
Trucks/. When a source uses DataSet1, it can
 take that collection as-is (the default), 
or narrow the set to /Vehicles/GM/Trucks/
Silverado/ or expand it to /Vehicles/.

There is artful design involved in the
 trade-offs between data set scope and 
source/sink scope. My practice is to define
 data sets somewhat broadly (thereby reducing
 the number of them), and then allow sources
 and sinks to narrow down what each needs in
 a particular situation.

This source uses the zipped data set shown 
above, narrows it, and makes sure to select
 only files actually named *.zip
 (otherwise the unzipping will fail).
