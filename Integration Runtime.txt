Integration Runtime:

An integration runtime provides the gateway
 between ADF and the actual data or compute
 resources you need. If you are using ADF to
 marshal native Azure resources, such as an
 Azure Data Lake or Databricks, then ADF knows 
how to talk to those resources. Just use the
 built-in integration runtime and don’t think 
about it — no set up or configuration required.

  But suppose you want ADF to operate on data 
that is stored on an Oracle Database server 
under your desk, or computers and data within
your company’s private network. In these
cases you must set up the gateway with a
Self-hosted integration runtime.

 This screenshot shows the built-in integration
runtime. It comes out of the box and and is
always there when you access native Azure
resources.
