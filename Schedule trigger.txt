Schedule trigger :

  This Azure Data Factory Trigger is a popular 
trigger that can run a Data Pipeline according
to a predetermined schedule. It provides 
extra flexibility by allowing for different 
scheduling intervals like minute(s), hour(s), 
day(s), week(s), or month(s). 

   You can set the start and end dates for the 
Schedule Trigger to be active so that it 
only runs a Pipeline based on the given
time period. Furthermore, you can also use
the Schedule Trigger to run on future 
calendar days and times, such as the 30th
of each month, the first and third Monday 
of each month, and more. 

    The Schedule Azure Data Factory Triggers 
are built with a “many to many” relationship
in mind, which implies that one Schedule
Trigger can run several Data Pipelines,
and a single Data Pipeline can be run by 
multiple Schedule Triggers
