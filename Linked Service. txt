Linked Service:

   A linked service tells ADF how to see the
particular data or computers you want to operate 
on. To access a specific Azurestorage account,
 you create a linked servicefor it and include
 access credentials. To read/write another
 storage account, you create another linked 
service. To allow ADF to operate on an Azure
 SQL database, your linked service will state
 the Azure subscription,server name, database
 name, and credentials.

    This screenshot shows a standard linked
 service for the most common Azure storage
 (Azure Data Lake Gen 2 container/blob).
