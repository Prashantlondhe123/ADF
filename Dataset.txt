Dataset:

     A data set makes a linked service more
specific; it describes the folder you are
using within a storage container, or the table
 within a database, etc.

  The data set in this screenshot points to one
directory in one container in one Azure storage 
account. (The container and directory names are
 set in the Parameters tab.) Note how the data
 set references a linked service. Note also
 that this data set specifies that the data is
 zipped, which allows ADF to automatically
 unzip the data as you read it.
